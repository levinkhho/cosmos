Binary search is a method for finding the index of an element in an already-sorted array. It works by repeatedly halving the array, picking the half that contains our element based on whether the middle element is lesser or greater than it, until the element is found. It's one of the simplest examples of a "divide and conquer" algorithm, which is an algorithm that repeatedly reduces the problem into smaller sub-problems until a solution is found.

Binary search runs in O(log n) time.
